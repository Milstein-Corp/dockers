## Information

TeamCity is a build management and continuous integration server from JetBrains. It was first released on October 2, 2006[2] and is commercial software and licensed under a proprietary license: a freemium license for up to 100 build configurations and three free Build Agent licenses are available. Open Source projects may request a free license.

TeamCity is a continuous integration and build management system. With TeamCity, you can set up a build server within minutes and enjoy out of the box continuous unit testing, code quality analysis, and early reporting on build problems â€” even without leaving your favorite IDE. TeamCity offers a gentle learning curve, so you can quickly improve your release management practices by gradually adopting its advanced features and capabilities.
